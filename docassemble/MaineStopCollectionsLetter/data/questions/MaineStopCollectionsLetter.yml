question: |
  Maine "Stop Collection" Form Letter
subquestion: |
  Use this interview to write a letter to creditors to ask them to stop trying to collect on a debt because your income and assets are <a href="https://www.ptla.org/debt#toc-is-any-of-my-income-or-property-safe-from-the-creditor-">exempt under Maine law (you are 'collections proof')</a>. 
  
  <h3>You can only use this form if:</h3> 
  <ol>
  <li>Your income and property are <a href="https://www.ptla.org/debt#toc-is-any-of-my-income-or-property-safe-from-the-creditor-">exempt from collection under Maine law</a></li>
  <strong>and</strong>
  <li>The debt you want to stop collections on is 'unsecured debt' like a credit card, medical debt, or a small loan from the bank - not a 'secured debt' like a car loan or a mortgage where you put up property as collateral.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Not sure if this is the right tool for you?</h3> 
  <ul>
  <li>You can learn more about what kinds of income and property are exempt from collection in Maine in our article <a href="https://www.ptla.org/debt#toc-is-any-of-my-income-or-property-safe-from-the-creditor-">Debt Collection in the Maine Courts</a></li>
  <li>We also offer a <a href="https://apps.ptla.org/start/debtvalidation/">Debt Validation Request Letter</a> (if you aren't sure you owe the debt or the amount of debt a creditor is trying to collect from you) and a <a href="https://apps.ptla.org/start/debthelper/">Debt Collection Hearing Helper</a> if you are being sued for a debt or need to go to a 'disclosure hearing.'</li>
  </ul>
  
  <strong>If this is the right tool for you, let's get started!</strong>
