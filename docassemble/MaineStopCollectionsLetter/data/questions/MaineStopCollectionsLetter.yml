  This question is used to introduce your interview. Please customize
id: SCL_intro
continue button field: StopCollections_intro
question: |
  Maine Stop Collections Form Letter
subquestion: |
  Use this interview to write a letter to creditors to ask them to stop trying to collect on a debt because your income and assets are exempt under Maine law (you are 'collections proof'). 
  
  You can only use this form if your income is exempt from collections under Maine law. (Insert info about that here!)
  
  This interview should only be used for unsecured debts (like a credit card), not debts like a mortgage or car loan.
